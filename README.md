<h1 align="center">🧠 Project Management Tool</h1>


<p align="center">A simple yet efficient console-based task and project management tool. Designed to help users track progress, manage deadlines, and organize tasks effectively using C# OOP principles, LINQ, and file persistence via JSON. Built with testing in mind using MSTest and structured for future expansion to EF Core and SQL Server via Docker.</p>
